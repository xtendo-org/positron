# Positron

Experiment.

Currently in an early-stage development.

## Memo

- `execParams` and `prepare` are available in protocol 3.0 which was introduced in PostgreSQL 7.4 (See [PostgreSQL 7.4 documentation on Frontend/Backend protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/protocol.html))
- There is a package 'uuid' but it has too many dependencies.
